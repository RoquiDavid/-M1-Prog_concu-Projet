 The strategy choosen is based on the hypothesis that all snakes know
 the position of the fruit. If they can go to the cell that represent
 the shortest way to fruit, they do it. But if the best(s) cell(s)
 are taken or obstacle part a random direction is choosen
 
 This strategy isn't the best and snake lose pretty often, but they can win or lose.
 you can decrease the amount of point to win if you want to check the victory condition
 instead of launch many the program

 A MUTEX is necessary to avoid two snake to earn points from the same fruit
 because they reach him at the same time.
